You should be able to extract detailed frame-information from videos, do caption searches, and use your findings to answer the question. You should be SUPER PICKY about your findings, NOT make assumptions, and always bias towards gathering more evidence before executing a final answer. Use EXACT evidence only. ALSO, when dealing with TEMPORAL questions, you cannot find VISUAL TIMES. If a question asks for a 'duration' of an event, you want to do many VLM queries on consecutive ranges, and find scene-changes at the beginning and end of the event. You MUST CHOOSE AN ANSWER. NONE OF THE ABOVE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE."

Her posture shifts to the children\u2019s eye\u2011level, indicating an intentional, interactive teaching style.  \n\n- **Children:** A small group (4\u20116) of children dressed in identical yellow uniforms. They are consistently the focus of the adult\u2019s attention, engaged in a craft\u2011/grid\u2011based activity that involves small objects, cards, and a yellow tray of props.  \n\n- **Secondary adult:** In frames\u202f2073,\u202f2086\u20112087 a second woman in a blue shirt is visible in the background, also participating in the activity. Her presence reinforces the setting as a classroom or daycare rather than a private/home environment.  \n\n- **Interaction dynamics:**  \n  * **Frame\u202f2057:** The adult stands at a table, demonstrating a small object while the children work on a craft.  \n  * **Frame\u202f2073:** She sits on the floor beside a large floor\u2011grid, supervising the children as they place objects/cards.  \n  * **Frames\u202f2085\u20112086:** She sits cross\u2011legged or side\u2011by\u2011side with a single child, speaking/singing and gesturing, suggesting individualized instruction or encouragement.  \n  * **Frame\u202f2087:** Kneeling, she holds a yellow tray of items, directing the whole group\u2019s attention to a hands\u2011on lesson.  \n\n- **Environment cues:** Classroom\u2011style walls with educational posters, a whiteboard, and assorted teaching materials. The uniformed children and the structured activities strongly point to an early\u2011childhood education setting.  \n\n- **Role inference:** The consistent adult\u2011child engagement, the use of teaching props, and the adult\u2019s positioning at children\u2019s level all indicate that the blue\u2011shirt woman is a **teacher/educator**. Her relationship with the children is that of **teacher\u2011student**, not parental or informal friendship.  \n\n- **Character tracking:**  \n  * **Woman\u202fA (blue shirt, hijab in later frames)** \u2013 present in all frames, transitions from standing instructor to floor\u2011level facilitator, remains the central guiding figure.  \n  * **Woman\u202fB (blue shirt, no hijab)** \u2013 appears only in later frames, assisting but not leading the activity.  \n  * **Children (yellow uniforms)** \u2013 remain the same cohort throughout, moving between group and one\u2011on\u2011one interactions with Woman\u202fA.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Across frames\u202f2057\u20112087, the video captures a teacher (blue\u2011shirt adult) leading a small class of uniformly dressed children through a series of craft and grid\u2011based learning activities, employing both whole\u2011group and individualized instruction while maintaining an engaging, floor\u2011level presence.",
